This project investigates the design and implementation of a duplicate question tagging model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge architecture in natural language processing (NLP) known for its robust ability to capture intricate, context-sensitive representations of language. Duplicate question tagging plays a crucial role in numerous systems, such as search engines, forums, and automated help desks, where correctly identifying and tagging similar or redundant queries enhances response accuracy and improves user experience by ensuring that users are presented with the most relevant information.
